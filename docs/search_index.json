The focus of the assignment will be on Salmonella enterica, an enteric pathogen that primarily spreads by human consumption of contaminated foods in Canada and the United States. Here, you will examine isolates of Salmonella serovar Heidelberg from three epidemiologically distinct foodborne outbreaks that occurred in Quebec, Canada between 2012-2014. For more detailed background on how the outbreaks happened, you are encouraged to read over the original publication by Bekal et al. (2014). You will be analyzing the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data generated from the study to investigate these foodborne outbreaks. Briefly, you will identify core genome single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from pre-assembled genomes, construct a core genome SNV phylogenetic tree and infer the evolutionary relationships of the isolates. In addition, you will annotate the bacterial genomes to detect the presence of various genetic features from this Salmonella outbreak dataset. The primary goal here is to integrate evidence from the phylogeny and genome annotations to justify which isolates are most likely epidemiologically linked (belong to the same outbreak). First, copy the assignment directory to your workspace on AWS: cp -r ~/CourseData/IDE_data/integrated_assignment_1/ ~/workspace/ cd ~/workspace/integrated_assignment_1 You can find the following files if you run the command ls ~/workspace/integrated_assignment_1: Assembled Salmonella genomes ~/workspace/integrated_assignment_1/assemblies Reference sequence (Heidelberg str. SL476) for variant calling: ~/workspace/integraintegrated_assignment_1/reference Metadata file ~/workspace/integrated_assignment_1/metadata.csv Required Tools Snippy FastTree ABRicate R Core Genome SNV Analysis To minimize the analysis runtime required, the SNV calling step using Snippy has already been done and you are provided a core genome SNV alignment to construct a phylogenetic tree in the next section. Additionally, you are provided a summary file that describes the number of SNVs identified and alignment statistics for each sample. SNV and alignment summary is located at: ~/workspace/integrated_assignment_1/alignment/core_aln_stats.txt Core genome alignment of the entire dataset is located at: ~/workspace/integrated_assignment_1/alignment/heidelberg_core.aln Description of SNV alignment summary headers: Header Description ID Sample identifier LENGTH Reference sequence length (bps) ALIGNED Reference sequence length aligned by query (bps) UNALIGNED Reference sequence length not aligned by query (bps) VARIANT Number of variants identified HET Number of heterozygous sites (mixed variants) MASKED Number of masked sites in reference sequence LOWCOV Number of aligned sites with low depth of coverage Review the summary file and the core genome alignment, and answer the following questions: 1. What is the length of the alignment and how is this length determined? Isolates of the same outbreak are more phylogenetically related (higher sequence similarity) than isolates collected from different outbreaks 2. Which isolate has the most detected variants relative to the reference genome? Which has the least? Isolates of the same outbreak are more phylogenetically related (higher sequence similarity) than isolates collected from different outbreaks 3. Which statistics in the variant calling summary file might be useful for identifying outlier (poor quality) samples and why? Isolates of the same outbreak are more phylogenetically related (higher sequence similarity) than isolates collected from different outbreaks Phylogenetic Analysis &amp; Visualization Here, you are tasked with using FastTree to construct a maximum likelihood tree from the core genome SNV alignment. When visualizing the phylogenetic tree, make note of any clustering patterns and which strains are closely/distantly related. To start, you will have to create your own environment with the needed tools (FastTree) and R packages (r-tidyverse and r-ggpubr). To do this you’ll use the following conda create command and then activate the environment: # Create command - 2 minutes conda create -n integrated-assignment-1 -c conda-forge -c bioconda fasttree r-tidyverse r-ggpubr --yes Hints Example FastTree usage: FastTree -nt sequence.aln &gt; tree.nwk. You’ll need to replace sequence.aln with the path to the correct alignment file Use the ggtree R package to generate a visualization of the phylogenetic tree (using your provided RStudio instance: xx.uhn-hpc.ca:8080, where xx is your assigned student number) Note ggtree is unavailable in your Rstudio session when you load it. Run the following commands to install and load it: if (!require(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) # you can ignore if you get a warning message about the Bioconductor version BiocManager::install(&quot;ggtree&quot;) library(ggtree) Helpful Starter Code: # make sure you are in the folder of the assignment #load files metadata&lt;-read.csv(&quot;metadata.csv&quot;) tree&lt;-read.tree(&quot;tree.nwk&quot;) Additional Tree Documentation: Visualizing phylogenetic trees Adding metadata to your trees 4. What does the phylogenetic tree inform you about the relatedness of the isolates within the same outbreak and across different outbreaks? Isolates of the same outbreak are more phylogenetically related (higher sequence similarity) than isolates collected from different outbreaks 5. Do the isolates cluster by isolation source (e.g. Human, Food) or isolation date? Isolates tend to cluster by isolation date. ___ Genome Annotation Predicting genes and other functional elements (e.g. transcriptional elements, replication origins, mobile elements) can help explain the differences in biological, epidemiological, and ecological characteristics of microbial organisms. Genome annotations are also critical for risk assessments of infectious disease pathogens, as the detection of multiple antimicrobial resistance (AMR) or virulent genes are suggestive of high risks to public health or patient health that require immediate attention. Here, you will use a tool called ABRicate to search for the presence of plasmids, AMR genes and virulence factors (VF). You will need to search against three different nucleotide databases that contain reference sequences of curated elements. Once you have identified the genetic elements carried by the bacterial genomes, you will generate heatmaps to visualize the results and identify any correlations amongst within-outbreak strains and between-outbreak strains. But first, you must install the ABRicate tool into your conda environment to be able to use it: # Conda install - 1 minute conda install -c bioconda abricate --yes How to Run ABRicate: Example ABRicate usage: abricate --db db_name contigs.fa &gt; report.tab The main parameter, --db specifies which database you would like to search against. There are different databases for different genetic elements. You can find the list of pre-downloaded sequence databases by executing: abricate --list To search for AMR genes, virulence factors, and plasmids, the database names are card, vfdb, and plasmidfinder, respectively Once you have generated the required ABRicate outputs for all Salmonella genomes, combine the results of all genomes by executing: abricate --summary /path/to/amr_results_dir/*.tab &gt; amr_summary.tab How to Visualize ABRicate Summary Results If you feel like challenging yourself with data visualization using R, then feel free to skip the instructions in this section and proceed to write your own codes in RStudio to plot the heatmaps. To help with results visualization, we have prepared a R script to generate heatmap plots directly from ABRicate summary results: # Clone the IDE2021_integrated_hw GitHub repository to your current working directory git clone https://github.com/jimmyliu1326/IDE2021_integrated_hw # Inside the cloned repository, you will find a script called `abricate_heatmap.R` # Example usage of the script Rscript abricate_heatmap.R /path/to/amr_summary.tab /path/to/amr_heatmap.png Hints: You can only query one genome against one database at a time (How would you automate the search for multiple genomes?) For each database (card, vfdb, plasmidfinder), organize the annotation results in a different directory 6. Can you infer which isolates are epidemiologically linked and which isolates are sporadic cases based on the presence/absence of the plasmids? Yes, the pattern of presence/absence of plasmids is distinct in each outbreak. 7. Do you see the same trend with AMR genes or virulence factors? No, the majority of isolates, regardless of the outbreak of origin, exhibit the same trend in virulence factors and AMR genes. 8. Looking at the AMR heatmap, which samples likely contain AMR genes encoded on plasmids and how would you verify this looking at ABRicate results? SH14-009 and SH08-001, because the heatmaps show that they carry 1-2 unique AMR genes that are not present in any other genomes in the dataset. Furthermore, in the plasmids heatmap, we also observe that SH14-009 and SH08-001 carry unique plasmids; hence the unqiue AMR genes are most likely encoded by these unique plasmids. To verify this, we first identify the contig name associated with the unique plasmids from the invidiual abricate results. For example, based on the plasmids heatmap, we observe that SH14-009 carries the unique plasmid, IncI1_1_Alpha. Running: grep IncI_1_Alpha abricate/plasmids/SH14-009.tab, we find that the unique plasmid is associated with the contig name, CP016585.1 Subsequently, we can search in the AMR results of SH14-009 to identify AMR genes that are present in the contig CP016585.1 by running grep CP016585.1 abricate/amr/SH14-009.tab. And indeed, we find that the contig contains two AMR genes: AAC(3)-VIa and ANT(3’’)-IIa, which in fact are the two AMR genes unique to SH14-009! 9. Aside from plasmids, AMR genes and VF, can you think of other genetic features in bacterial genomes that may help discriminate between these outbreaks? CRISPR arrays, insertional elements, genomic Islands, phage elements, integrative conjugative elements Integrative Assignment 2 Introduction In late 2021, South Africa experienced a resurgence in SARS-CoV-2 cases that was accompanied by an increase of Spike-gene diagnostic assay PCR failures. This specific diagnostic characteristic was associated with the earlier Alpha Variant of Concern (VOC) and not of the currently circulating Delta VOC. Due to this, a targeted sequencing effort was initiated to investigate this unusual variant. A new, genetically distinct lineage was quickly identified. Cases linked to this lineage rapidly increased in both South Africa and subsequently worldwide with it being designated as a new WHO VOC called Omicron in under 10 days from the initial sequencing result. You are interested in performing a genomic epidemiological investigation of the source, evolutionary relationship, and genetic characteristics of this newly emergent lineage. To do this, you have randomly sampled a small subset of the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages hosted on GISAID from the onset of the pandemic until early 2022 supplemented with a subset of the first reported Omicron sequences from both South Africa and Canada. Important terms on variant typing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: Pango Lineage / Lineage: Variant type called using the Pangolin tool which provides a finely-detailed nomenclature on the input genome based on all of the currently designated lineages. Nextstrain Clade / Clade: Variant typing called using the Nextstrain naming guidelines/tools. These clades are a bit more relaxed than the Pangolin lineages with the aim to new clades created by significant differences in biological impact or circulation patterns. WHO Variants of Concern: Variants designated by the WHO and given an easy to say greek alphabet label This integrated assignment will focus on the genomic epidemiological analysis of the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 VOC Omicron using tools and methods covered in the other modules of the course. Once finished the assignment, check out the published paper on the epidemiological investigation of early Omicron from South Africa: Published Paper Viana, R., Moyo, S., Amoako, D.G. et al. Rapid epidemic expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in southern Africa. Nature 603, 679–686 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04411-y List of Software Utilized Augur mafft iqtree timetree Auspice Nextclade Rebar The workshop machines already have this software installed within a conda environment called integrated-assignment-2. Assignment Setup Copy Data Files To begin, we will copy over the assignment files to ~/workspace. Commands cp -r ~/CourseData/IDE_data/integrated_assignment_2/data/ ~/workspace/integrated_assignment_2 cd ~/workspace/integrated_assignment_2 This will copy over the 3 files that you need to do the assignment, which you can check with ls and should give: metadata.tsv selected_sequences.fasta sequences.fasta Activate Environment Activate the conda environment integrated-assignment-2 which has all of the tools used in this assignment. Verify your Workshop Machine URL This exercise will produce output files intended to be viewed in a web browser. These should be accessible by going to http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca in your web browser where xx is your particular number (like 01, 02, etc.). Phylogenetic Construction As seen previously in Module 8, we are going to construct a phylogenetic tree using the Augur tool suite, this time with a set of global SARS-CoV-2 sequences and their associated metadata subsampled from GISAID. Revisit that module to refamiliarize yourself with the commands if needed! You can also run COMMAND --help to gain more information on the parameters associated with each of the tools used. The structure of this section has all of the full commands hidden by default so you can practice constructing your own commands. It will take around 10 minutes total for the commands to execute. Tip When running through the assignment, remember to keep track of what you name your output files as each step builds off of the previously generated output files. If you are figuring out your own commands and comparing them to the full given commands there will likely be differences in these parameter inputs! Note There are some potential differences that can occur in the final tree topology due to the random seeding of the initial parsimony trees and the small number of iterations run (not running any bootstrapping). To enforce a common tree topology, we are going to use a fixed seed of 100 when building the trees. Step 1: Construct a Multiple Sequence Alignment Using augur align and the --reference-name Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 reference sequence that is found in the given sequences.fasta file, construct a multiple sequence alignment using four threads. Command and Parameters Command: # 1. Align with Augur using mafft - 2 min augur align \\ --nthreads 4 \\ --sequences sequences.fasta \\ --reference-name &#39;Wuhan-Hu-1/2019&#39; \\ --output aligned.fasta Parameters: --nthreads 4: Use 4 threads for the alignment --sequences sequences.fasta: Input set of sequences including the reference in fasta format --reference-name &#39;Wuhan-Hu-1/2019&#39;: The reference Wuhan-1 genome identifier found in our sequences file to remove insertions relative to --output aligned.fasta: Output alignment file in fasta format Step 2: Build a Maximum Likelihood Phylogenetic Tree Next, using augur tree and your newly generated multiple sequence alignment with --alignment, construct a maximum likelihood tree. Include the --tree-builder-args \"-seed 100\" parameter in your command to keep all assignment trees matching, and remember that output trees should be formatted in the newick format with the .nwk extension. Use four threads. Command and Parameters Command: # 2. Build Maximum Likelihood Phylogenetic Tree with Augur using iqtree2 - 40 sec augur tree \\ --nthreads 4 \\ --alignment aligned.fasta \\ --tree-builder-args &quot;-seed 100&quot; \\ --output tree.nwk Parameters: --nthreads 4: Use 4 threads for building the ML tree --alignment aligned.fasta`: Input multiple sequence alignment file from the previous step --tree-builder-args &quot;-seed 100&quot;: Seed given to iqtree to keep all output tree topology the same --output tree.nwk: Output phylogenetic tree in newick format Step 3: Infer Time Tree The next step is to infer a time tree using the augur refine --timetree command along with your multiple sequence alignment (--alignment), provided metadata, and newly generated maximum likelihood --tree newick file.

Step 1: Load Data into Auspice Download the ouput Auspice JSON file and the metadata.tsv file by right-clicking Save link as.... Go to https://auspice.us/ and drag and drop in the saved JSON file and the metadata.tsv file to visualize your created phylogenetic tree with metadata. Spend a bit exploring the tree and seeing where all of the clades are along with how the branch lengths compare when visualized by both Time and Divergence. Step 2: Answer the Following Questions Using the Visualization and Prompts Looking at the time phylogeny, find both Omicron and Delta on the tree (hint: Colour by “clade_who”). Noting that Omicron emerged when the Delta lineages were prevalent globally, from the phylogeny: 1. What can you infer about the relationship between the Delta and Omicron variants? 2. What is the lineage of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of both Delta and Omicron? (hint: Remember lineage is from Pangolin. Colour the tree by “pangolin_lineage”) Next, zoom in on the Omicron clade. 3. Based on your tree, where and when was the first Omicron case identified? Is there enough evidence in our tree to say this is where Omicron emerged? (Hint: Label tips by country, click on the nodes, explore around) The emergence of Omicron was characterized by three distinct lineages that were all detected at roughly the same time in the order of: BA.1, BA.2, and then BA.3. 4. When was the MRCA of all 3 of the Omicron lineages (BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3) predicted to be? What about BA.2 and BA.3? 5. What does this tell you about the diversification of the Omicron VOC prior to its detection in the population? Zooming back out, the Omicron clade has an unusually long branch length back to its most recent common ancestor suggesting a period of unsampled diversification of before its emergence. 6. Which lineage does Omicron appear to have diverged from? 7. How long a period of unsampled diversity do you estimate for the Omicron VOC based on the inferred dates? 8. Based on all of the previous answers, what hypotheses for the emergence of Omicron are consistent with your observations? Is there anything about the country of origin that suggests one hypothesis over another? Now, set the branch length from Time to Divergence and view the tree in a Radial layout. Colour by who_clade. 9. Do any of the other WHO VOCs (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) show a similar phylogenetic emergence structure to that of Omicron? What, if anything, can you conclude about the emergence of VOCs? Nextclade Analysis You are looking to explore the different molecular profiles of the VOCs by analysing and visualizing them using nextclade and comparing them to Omicron. Nextclade is a tool that performs genetic sequence alignment, clade assignment, mutation calling, phylogenetic placement, and quality checks for different viral pathogens. It can be run either on the command line or locally in your browser (no data leaves your computer!) Remember to keep your auspice tree open to assist in analyzing the VOCs. The WHO VOCs are: Alpha Beta Gamma Delta Omicron Step 1: Download the selected_sequences.fasta file to your computer and then load it into nextclade by dragging it into your browser. Then set the dataset to the official SARS-CoV-2 dataset and click run. Step 2: Using Nextclade, Answer the Following Questions Nextclade will show the distribution of mutations along either specific genes or over the whole genome with the default view being set to show mutations in the Spike protein. 10. The TaqPath three-gene RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 experienced diagnostic failures for Alpha due to the 69-70del mutation in one of the assay primers. This assay failed in the same target in some of the the initial Omicron lineages. Based on the nextclade visualization, which lineage(s) contain this mutation? Change the view from the default of spike to the ‘Nucleotide sequence’ option to view the full distribution of mutations across the genome 11. Can you find any other mutations in Omicron that are common to the other VOCs? Given the phylogenetic relationship of the VOCs, can you provide a hypothesis for your observation of common mutations between them? 12. In which gene(s) are the mutations of the VOCs concentrated? Why is this the case? Recombination Analysis With both of the Delta and Omicron VOCs circulating in the population at the same time in December 2021, there was ample opprotunity for co-infections to occur with a high probability of recombination events happening. This lead to the first “deltacron” recombinat being identified in France in January 2022. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 sequences consist of genomic elements from two different lineages/variants with one or more breakpoints in which the recombination occured. To identify potential recombinants and breakpoints, we are going to use the tool rebar that follows the PHA4GE Guidance for Detecting and Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 Recombinants for detecting and visualizing SARS-CoV-2 recombination. Step 1: Download First, we have to download a version controlled SARS-CoV-2 dataset for rebar to be able to detect breakpoints and recombinants. For more information on what is contained in a dataset, checkout the rebar dataset page. As a quick introduction though, the dataset directory consists minimally of: The Wuhan-1 reference genome Population fasta file with known clades/lineages aligned to the reference To download the required dataset to be able to detect recombinants, you will have to use the rebar dataset download command. This command requires an input dataset name (--name sars-cov-2), an input date tag, which we will use --tag 2023-11-30 for, and an --output-dir to save the dataset to. Remember, you can almost always run TOOL --help to get more info on how to run a tool. Command and Parameters Command: Command: # 1. Download dataset to run rebar - 10 sec rebar dataset download \\ --name sars-cov-2 \\ --tag 2023-11-30 \\ --output-dir dataset/2023-11-30 Parameters: --name sars-cov-2: Input dataset name to grab --tag 2023-11-30: Input date tag for the dataset --output-dir dataset/2023-11-30: Output directory name to save the dataset to Step 2: Run Next, run the rebar run command using the newly created --dataset-dir and your initial aligned fasta file (--alignment) to begin the process of detecting any potential recombinant genomes in our input sequences. Output data again should be saved to a specified --output-dir. Command and Parameters Command: # 2. Run rebar detection - 2 minutes rebar run \\ --dataset-dir dataset/2023-11-30 \\ --alignment aligned.fasta \\ --output-dir rebar_recombination Parameters: --dataset-dir dataset/2023-11-30: Input SARS-CoV-2 dataset downloaded in the prior step --alignment aligned.fasta: Input aligned fasta file all the way back from augur align --output-dir rebar_recombination: Output directory for rebar to save to Step 3: Plot Finally, run rebar plot to create visualizations of the potential recombinants detected using the previous output --run-dir and the --annotations file found in your downloaded rebar dataset from step 1 (hint: This file is called annotations.tsv). Command and Parameters Command: Command: # 3. Plot rebar detections - 5 sec rebar plot \\ --run-dir rebar_recombination \\ --annotations dataset/2023-11-30/annotations.tsv Parameters: --run-dir rebar_recombination: Input directory containing rebar run results to be used for plotting --annotations dataset/2023-11-30/annotations.tsv: Input annotations file containing a table of genome annotations to add to the plot Questions Now view the PNG images produced by Rebar (found in rebar_recombination/plots) and answer the following questions for the XB, XD, and XF recombinants detected: 13. What lineages comprise the recombinant? 14. In which genes do recombination break points occur? With the knowledge of which samples were detected as recombinants along with which lineages make up their recombination, look back at the time tree and find the detected recombinant samples (hint: Colour by who_clade). 15. Where do the the XD and XF recombinant samples place on the phylogeny? Are they located where you’d expect based on their components? Would you expect their placement to be accurate?

You will be guided through the analysis workflow and subsequent exploration of the data and quality control results. At the end of the lab you will know: How to analyze amplicon sequencing data from the Illumina sequencing instrument How to assess the quality of a sequenced sample How to assess single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for SARS-CoV-2 variant calls How to view the evolutionary changes of SARS-CoV-2 and interpret differences between lineages belonging to variants of concern (i.e., Alpha vs. Delta variants) Data Sets In this lab we will use subset of data from the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK) to demonstrate analysis of SARS-CoV-2. This data set consists of short-read sequencing reads collected as part of the COVID-19 Pandemic response and will be a mix of different variants of concern (VOCs) up to the end of summer 2021. This would include predominantly Alpha (also known as PANGO lineage B.1.1.7; first designated December 2020) and Delta (also known as PANGO lineage B.1.617.2; first designated in May 2021) variants. We have provided publicly available Illumina short-reads and you will run SARS-CoV-2 Illumina GeNome Assembly Line (SIGNAL) with additional quality control and assessment using ncov-tools. Prior to the workshop the instructors downsampled the sequencing data from ~10,000x coverage to ~200x coverage to reduce the time it takes to run the analysis; however, running the pipelines use the exact same set of commands and the results you will obtain are comparable to assembling using the full dataset. In the following instructions the commands you should run are shown in code blocks like so: echo &quot;Hello world&quot; You can type these commands into your terminal, or copy and paste them. Data Download and Preparation First, lets create and move to a directory that we’ll use to organize our results: mkdir -p workspace/module5 cd workspace/module5 From within your module5 directory, you can create a symlink which is a shortcut to where the raw sequencing data is stored: ln -s ~/CourseData/IDE_data/module5/cbw_demo_run/ If you run ls you should see only one directory: cbw_demo_run. You can view the contents of the cbw_demo_run directory using ls: ls cbw_demo_run You should see 36 pairs of files. Each pair of files is the raw sequencing data for a single sample. The first half of the Illumina paired-end reads is stored in files ending in _R1.fastq.gz and the second half in _R2.fastq.gz. The samples are identified with accession numbers like ERR5338522, a unique identifier of a sample that has been deposited in a public database. You can view the contents of one of the data files by decompressing it and piping it to head: zcat cbw_demo_run/ERR5338522_R1.fastq.gz | head Question: what do the different lines in a FASTQ file mean? If you can’t figure it out ask an instructor or on slack! Running SIGNAL The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data is complex and uses a number of different tools that are run sequentially in a pipeline. The pipeline we will use to analyze this data is called SIGNAL. First, we need to clone a copy of SIGNAL from github and then enter the directory this command creates: git clone --recursive https://github.com/jaleezyy/covid-19-signal cd covid-19-signal Ensure that your current working directory is within the covid-19-signal directory using pwd. Next, we need to switch to the version of SIGNAL that we will use for this workshop. This version tells SIGNAL that we have installed all of the software we used in a single conda environment: git checkout single-conda Finally, we need to activate the conda environment containing the software SIGNAL requires, and create a symlink to the reference files SIGNAL needs. You can also review the SIGNAL help screen to see our options: conda activate signalcovtools ln -s ~/CourseData/IDE_data/module5/data/ python signalexe.py -h The data directory you have linked should be found within ~/workspace/module5/covid-19-signal/data. In order to run SIGNAL, we first need to prepare two files: a configuration file, where all of our assembly parameters will be assigned, and a sample table, which will list the indivdual samples and the location of corresponding R1 and R2 FASTQs. Remember that our sequencing data is located one directory level up (i.e., ../cbw_demo_run/). Generating the required files can all be done using the following command: python signalexe.py --directory ../cbw_demo_run --config-only The output should be as follows If you run ls you should see cbw_demo_run_config.yaml and cbw_demo_run_sample_table.csv files have been created. You can use more or less to examine the input files. Reference-based Assembly using SIGNAL Using our configuration file as input, we can begin our assembly of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing reads. Run the following: python signalexe.py --configfile cbw_demo_run_config.yaml --quiet --cores 4 all postprocess This will take around 30-45 minutes to run, so is a good time for a short break. Quality Control and Assessment Now that SIGNAL is complete, we will run an additional step to generate some quality control results: python signalexe.py --configfile cbw_demo_run_config.yaml --quiet --cores 4 ncov_tools Coverage Analysis We can now start exploring the results. First we will look at the depth of coverage to make sure that each viral genome was covered by enough sequencing reads to call an accurate consensus sequence. Open your web browser and navigate to http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca/module5/covid-19-signal/cbw_demo_run_results_dir/ where xx is the instance ID you were assigned. This directory stores the results of SIGNAL and ncov-tools. In the ncov-tools-results/plots/ subdirectory you will find a file called cbw_demo_run_results_dir_depth_by_position.pdf. Open this file. This file contains plots of the coverage depth for each of the 36 samples we analyzed as shown below. Explore the results and try to understand what the coverage patterns mean: What might have caused the sharp drop in coverage for sample ERR6035561? What about the uneven coverage in sample ERR5508530? As explained in the lecture, sequencing coverage is a critical factor for determining the completeness of the genome assembly. In the terminal, let’s view the consensus sequence for sample ERR5508530: less cbw_demo_run_results_dir/ERR5508530/freebayes/ERR5508530.consensus.fasta What do you see? The consensus sequences for other samples are in directories with similiar names, take a look at them. Can you draw any conclusions about the quality of the results? ncov-tools creates a file that summarizes the genome completeness for every sample. Run this command in the terminal: cut -f1,10,15 cbw_demo_run_results_dir/ncov-tools-results/qc_reports/cbw_demo_run_results_dir_summary_qc.tsv This command uses cut to find the metrics that we are interested in from the full QC results table. What is the completeness of ERR5508530? What about ERR6035561? Assessing SNP Calls Now, using your browser open the file located at ncov-tools-results/plots/cbw_demo_run_results_dir_tree_snps.pdf. This plot arranges the samples using a phylogenetic tree (shown on the left) so that samples with a similar sequence are grouped together. The panel on the right shows SNPs within each sample with respect to the MN908947.3 reference genome, where each colour represents a different base. Also shown on the plot are the pangolin-assigned lineages; B.1.1.7 is the alpha variant, AY.4 is delta. Notice that there are many SNPs in common between the alpha samples and a different set of SNPs in common between the delta samples. These SNPs are what define the different lineages. Now, we’re going to inspect the read-level evidence for some example SNPs. Open up IGV and using the first dropdown menu select the “SARS-CoV-2” genome. Now, click on the File menu and select “Load from URL” and paste in the path http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca/module5/covid-19-signal/cbw_demo_run_results_dir/ERR5389257/core/ERR5389257_viral_reference.mapping.bam again replacing xx with your instance ID. Once the file loads you will see the pattern of read coverage along the genome. Paste the coordinates NC_045512.2:2,917-3,156 into the navigation bar. This region shows a single C&gt;T SNP where every read supports the alternative allele (the red bars in the middle of the screen). Now, navigate to NC_045512.2:631-870. In this case some reads have evidence for a C&gt;T SNP but other reads have evidence for the reference allele at this position. Since this position is ambiguous the consensus genome will be marked with an ambiguity code. Going back to the mutations plot, look for the row corresponding to sample ERR5389257. Notice that it has a black bar in between two purple SNPs at the beginning of the genome - that is the ambiguous position that we are inspecting at IGV. Since this position is only ambiguous in ERR5389257 we can’t draw many conclusions from it - it could be due to low-level contamination, a PCR artificat, or heterogeneity within this sample. You can view all of the variants for a sample by using less on their VCF files: less cbw_demo_run_results_dir/ERR5389257/freebayes/ERR5389257.variants.norm.vcf Take a bit of time to look at other variants for this sample (or other samples!). If you find something interesting or unexpected tell the rest of the class in slack and we can discuss it as a group. Variant Consequence Prediction Once we have variant calls we can run a mutation consequence predictor to determine the protein-level changes. This is important as the identification of new variants relies on determining whether the mutations increase the fitness of the lineage, which is usually determined at the amino acid level. View this file in your terminal: less cbw_demo_run_results_dir/ncov-tools-results/qc_annotation/ERR5389257_aa_table.tsv This file is a table of predicted amino acid changes for each protein. How many changes to the spike protein does this sample have? Let’s compare that number to a different sample from another lineage. First, let’s figure out the lineage of sample ERR5389257: grep ERR5389257 cbw_demo_run_results_dir/lineage_assignments.tsv The file lineage_assignments.tsv is produced by pangolin and by grepping (searching the file) for sample ERR5389257 we can see that it is B.1.1.7 (Alpha). Look in the lineage_assignments.tsv file to find the identifier for a delta sample, then use it’s consequence prediction file to count the number of spike mutations. Is it more or less than ERR5389257? We probably wouldn’t want to draw strong conclusions from the number of mutations as many will be neutral (or even deleterious) but this type of analysis - looking at mutation consequence - cross-referenced with other data (for example experimental fitness assays) is what goes into identifying VOCs. "],["module-6-bacterial-pathogen-genomic-analysis---genome-based-subtyping.html", "Module 6: Bacterial Pathogen Genomic Analysis - Genome-based Subtyping Lecture Lab", " Module 6: Bacterial Pathogen Genomic Analysis - Genome-based Subtyping Lecture Lab Introduction Our overall aim for this computer lab is to perform core genome Multi-Locus Sequencing Typing (cgMLST) analysis, a genome-based typing method widely adopted in bacterial genomic surveillance networks across the globe. As discussed in the lecture, the widespread adoption of cgMLST is due in large part to recent advances in high-throughput sequencing, which have enabled the routine deployment of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in microbial surveillance. Concomitant with the wider availability of WGS data has been the need to develop approaches to analyze these data. Part of this effort has centered on adapting the Multi-Locus Sequence Typing approach originally described by Maiden et al. (1998) to genome scales and coupling it to existing microbial surveillance infrastructure. The implementation of cgMLST by the PulseNet Canada and the wider PulseNet International network for foodborne outbreak surveillance has made it possible for WGS data to be used as evidence in public health investigations and public health interventions. You will conduct a retrospective analysis on data from a hypothetical enteric pathogen that is primarily transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated foods and water. The dataset comprises allele data and contextual metadata on isolates collected from human and non-human surveillance and may include potential outbreaks. We have provided you with this R markdown file composed of a custom workflow written in the R language for statistical computing that includes modules to perform various steps in genomic epidemiologic analysis using cgMLST data. The workflow comprises: Identifying low quality, accessory and core loci in the dataset Identifying genomes with low quality allele profiles and dataset quality control Computing cgMLST distances using the Hamming distance Hierarchical clustering of cgMLST distance matrices Extracting genomic clusters at different similarity thresholds Analyzing genomic clusters for variables of interest Visualizing basic dendrograms annotated with epidemiological metadata Your challenge will be to leverage the tools and data at your disposal to establish high quality cgMLST profiles that can be used to infer genetic relatedness and to explore patterns in the data in order to synthesize possible interpretations based on all available genomic and epidemiological data, including possible outbreaks and their potential sources. Learning Objectives The significance of metrics used for cgMLST quality control Core and accessory loci and their use in MLST analysis Computing similarity matrices and building dendrograms from MLST data Distance thresholding to generate genomic clusters for downstream analyses Using the ggtree R library for tree visualizations Linking epidemiological data to dendrograms to infer possible outbreak scenarios Timeline for Training Day 1: Pre-processing and Preliminary Analyses a.

Evaluation of genomic clusters (Part 2) Analysis of genomic clusters using metadata variables of interest via stacked histogram b. Visualizations using full dendrograms Visualization of clustered distance matrix as a heatmap Visualization of annotated radial and rectangular dendrograms Visualization of individual genomic clusters using annotated sub-trees The code is intended so that it can be re-used on similar allelic data. This dataset consists of allelic profiles from isolates recovered from samples collected from a diverse range of geographical regions in Canada, different sources, and dating back to the early 2000s. Note Because generating assemblies from raw reads and allele calling are computationally and time-intensive steps in the analysis, in this exercise we will be using pre-computed allelic data generated from WGS assemblies using the commercial software BioNumerics, which is currently used by the PulseNet International network. Getting Started Let’s begin by installing (if needed) and loading all R packages and helper scripts required to run all the code in this lab.

Day 1: Pre-processing and Preliminary Analyses ComputeCompleteness for all Loci Based on Initial Set of Genomes We first need to evaluate cgMLST data quality by applying criteria to determine whether the properties of the allele profiles meet quality standards. Incomplete genome assemblies will generate missing information in the form of unassigned allele calls when loci collide with gaps in assemblies. Accessory loci can similarly generate significant numbers of unsassigned alleles since they are not necessary present on a given genome. Even modest levels of unassigned alleles will compromise the precision of genetic similarity calculations used for inferring relationships between the various genomes in dataset. Hence, care must be taken to exclude loci/genomes with excessive levels of unassigned alleles. Our first step will be to compute basic allele completion stats on every locus and every genome in the dataset by running the code chunk below: # use compute_lc helper function to compute # allele assig*nment rate (completeness) # across all loci loci_completeness &lt;- compute_lc(wgMLST) # write raw summary to quality_summary sub-folder in the output folder write.table(loci_completeness, here(&quot;output&quot;,&quot;quality_summary&quot;,&quot;wgmlst_loci_quality.stats.tsv&quot;), quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) # plot of allele distribution across genomes using function &quot;plot_loci_completeness&quot; plot_loci_completeness(loci_completeness) # print summary statistics for loci completeness summary(loci_completeness) ## locus valid_alleles missing_alleles completeness ## Length:1343 Min. : 0.0 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.00 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:400.0 1st Qu.: 0.00 1st Qu.: 99.50 ## Mode :character Median :402.0 Median : 0.00 Median :100.00 ## Mean :391.3 Mean : 10.71 Mean : 97.34 ## 3rd Qu.:402.0 3rd Qu.: 2.00 3rd Qu.:100.00 ## Max. :402.0 Max. :402.00 Max. :100.00 Note Note that within the main R studio pane, all plots can be popped out to a new window by clicking on the left-most button at the top right of the plot. Questions: Based on the table above, can you tell roughly how many loci have full assignment across the initial set of 402 genomes in the dataset? What breakdown of core/accessory genes can you predict at this stage of the analysis? Based on the plot, how many genomes would definitely need to be excluded based on exceeding a &gt;1% missing allele threshold if all 1343 loci are used? cgMLST Quality Control If an allele table contains accessory loci, these should be excluded from cgMLST analysis. Because they are expected to be found on an assembly of decent quality, core loci are an extremely powerful tool in the evaluation of genomes for QC. Part of the process of defining a cgMLST schema is in identifying the core loci to include (and the accessory loci to exclude!) from the analysis. The challenge lies with the fact that unless you have access to a pre-defined set of core loci via an existing cgMLST schema, you must first define these core loci by using completeness in the dataset. However, genomes with an excess of unassigned alleles will result in the needless exclusion of loci wrongly flagged as accessory on the basis of incompleteness. At the same time, the inclusion of accessory loci during the quality assessment of genomes will result in the needless exclusion of genomes wrongly flagged as poor quality simply because of missing accessory loci. We’re stuck in a classic case of trying to fly an airplane while flying it. Note Accessory genes can be used in MLST analysis but their use must be highly prescribed. Although, as mentioned above, their presence on a given genome is a bit of a coin-flip, patterns of accessory gene presence tend to follow along genomic sublineages. So using accessory genomes to examine more limited subsets of highly-related genomes can provide additional discriminatory power. But when dealing with datasets of unknowns, core loci provide the most robust solution. The ultimate goal here is to define a set of core loci that can be used for genome QC. So we have to implement a phased-in approach to attempt to tease apart unassigned allele calls from accessory loci from unassigned calls due to incomplete assemblies. Here, we use the compute_gc helper function to compute the allele completion rate for each locus using a large sample that excludes genomes suspected to be of poor quality. We create this sample by applying a user-defined cut-off currently set to use the top 75% genomes in terms of overall allele calls (i.e. the 75% genome cohort). This ensures that we side-step genomes with lots of unassigned allele calls since these will skew locus completeness, affecting the identification of core loci. This also ensures that a sufficiently large enough number of genomes is being used to define core loci that should be identifiable on a typical high quality genome in the dataset. Here, we define a core locus as having a completion rate above 99.5% in the 75% genome cohort. Note The process to define a core schema that we describe here is a bit ad hoc but it will do in a pinch. We suggest using a more formal schema-building tool if you are embarking in the analysis of an oganism without one. For example, software tools like chewBBACCA have been developed to automate and bring rigor to the schema-building process. Once core loci have been identified, it’s time to circle back and re-compute the completion rate for these core loci only. Because core loci should be present in every genome, any unassigned calls are due to genome quality issues. We thus apply a genome inclusion/exclusion quality threshold currently set to 99% so that genomes with &gt;1% unassigned core loci are excluded from further analysis. The code chunk below proceeds through a series of steps to compute the frequency of unassigned alleles across each locus (i.e. columns) and each genome (i.e. rows) in the allele table. This information will be used to estimate a set of loci that are core to the genomes in the dataset, and these will subsequently inform the identification of poor quality loci/genomes to exclude from downstream analyses. # Identification of core loci using compute_gc helper function genome_completion&lt;- compute_gc(wgMLST) # identify cohort of higher quality genomes to be used for assessing completion rate to identify core loci top_genomes &lt;- genome_completion%&gt;% arrange(desc(valid_alleles))%&gt;% slice(1:as.integer(nrow(genome_completion)*0.75)) # Adjustable parameter currently set to 75% # filter for the top X% (e.g. 75%) of genomes based on overall allele completion top_wgMLST &lt;- wgMLST%&gt;% filter(ID%in%top_genomes$ID) ## compute allele assignment rate (i.e. completeness) using compute_lc helper for the top 75% cohort top_genome_completion &lt;- compute_lc(top_wgMLST) ## define core_threshold and core loci using a user-defined comleteness threshold (e.g. 99.5%) using the top 75% cohort core_loci &lt;- top_genome_completion %&gt;% filter(completeness &gt;99.5 ) ## Core loci defined as present in &gt;99.5% of 75% cohort # compute quality assessment (QA) for all genomes using the core_loci using the compute_gc() helper cgmlst &lt;- wgMLST%&gt;%select(1, core_loci$locus) cgmlst_genome_completion &lt;- compute_gc(cgmlst) # define quality control (QC) threshold for the maximum percentage of missing cgMLST calls for inclusion/exclusion QC_threshold &lt;- as.integer(ncol(cgmlst)*0.01) + 1 ## Up to 1% missing core loci per genome allowed ## create cgMLST QC report (1: meets the QC standard, 0: fails the QC standard) cgmlst_QC &lt;- cgmlst_genome_completion %&gt;% mutate(QC_cgmlst = case_when(missing_alleles &lt; QC_threshold ~ 1, T ~ 0)) # output cgMLST quality file write.table(cgmlst_QC, here(&quot;output&quot;,&quot;quality_summary&quot;,&quot;cgmlst_genome_qual.stats.tsv&quot;), quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) # print data summary of cgmlst completeness summary(cgmlst_genome_completion) ## ID valid_alleles missing_alleles completeness ## Length:402 Min. :1066 Min. : 0.000 Min. : 96.73 ## Class :character 1st Qu.:1100 1st Qu.: 0.000 1st Qu.: 99.82 ## Mode :character Median :1102 Median : 0.000 Median :100.00 ## Mean :1100 Mean : 2.226 Mean : 99.80 ## 3rd Qu.:1102 3rd Qu.: 2.000 3rd Qu.:100.00 ## Max. :1102 Max. :36.000 Max. :100.00 Questions: The table above describes summary statistics for the set of core loci defined by the process for this particular dataset. Based on these data: how many core loci have been designated? How many genomes definitely pass a quality threshold based on &lt; 1% missing alleles? Generate Finalized Dataset Utilizing Custom cgMLST Schema Based on the Core Loci Identified Above We have identified core loci and have used them to assess genome quality on the original genomes in the dataset. It’s time to put it all together and finalize the dataset by generating an x by y allele table comprising the allelic profiles of x high quality genomes at y core loci by running the code chunk below: # define final genomes that passed QC step final_genomes &lt;- cgmlst_QC %&gt;% filter(QC_cgmlst &gt; 0) # define final cgMLST allele table based on QC-passed genomes &amp; core loci cgmlst_final &lt;- cgmlst%&gt;% filter(ID%in%final_genomes$ID) # define final cgMLST meta data table by excluding QC-failed genomes metadata &lt;- meta %&gt;% filter(ID%in%cgmlst_final$ID)%&gt;% mutate(across(everything(), as.character)) # write finalized cgMLST allele table and metadata table to files write.table(cgmlst_final, here(&quot;data&quot;,&quot;wgMLST_calls&quot;,&quot;cgmlst_final.tsv&quot;), quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) write.table(metadata, here(&quot;data&quot;,&quot;metadata&quot;,&quot;cgmlst_final_metadata.tsv&quot;), quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) # print filtering results message(paste(&quot;Number of original loci:&quot;, ncol(wgMLST)-1)) ## Number of original loci: 1343 message(paste(&quot;Number of core loci included:&quot;, ncol(cgmlst_final)-1)) ## Number of core loci included: 1102 message(paste(&quot;Number of accessory loci excluded:&quot;,ncol(wgMLST)- ncol(cgmlst_final)-1)) ## Number of accessory loci excluded: 240 message(paste(&quot;Number of genomes before filter:&quot;, nrow(cgmlst_genome_completion))) ## Number of genomes before filter: 402 message(paste(&quot;Number of genomes after filter:&quot;, nrow(cgmlst_final))) ## Number of genomes after filter: 381 message(paste(&quot;Number of genomes removed:&quot;,nrow(cgmlst_genome_completion)-nrow(cgmlst_final))) ## Number of genomes removed: 21 Questions: How do your earlier predictions compare against these final numbers? i.e. did the process yield more accessory loci or high quality genomes than you predicted? Calculating the Hamming Distance The traditional approach for cgMLST analysis is based on computing pairwise distances between allele profiles as a proxy for the underlying genetic similarity between two isolates. Below, you are introduced to a distance metric called the Hamming distance, which is based on computing the number of differences between a pair of character vectors. The Hamming distance is useful for comparing profiles where a majority of characters are defined, such as profiles comprising core loci. Given two character vectors of equal lengths, the Hamming distance is the total number of positions in which the two vectors are different: Profile A: [ 0 , 2 , 0 , 5 , 5 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] Profile B: [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 4 , 3 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] A != B: [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] Hamming distance = sum( A != B ) = 3 Note In phylogenetic analysis, distance-based approaches are rather flexible in the sense that they can be constructed from any measure that estimates genetic similarity through the direct comparison of data points. In cgMLST, we compare allele profiles. In Mash, we compare k-mer profiles. In the context of two cgMLST profiles, the Hamming distance is calculated based on the number of allele differences across all loci as a proportion of total number of loci evaluated. Note cgMLST profiles are composed of mostly complete data. If you were to include accessory loci, not that you will, this will introduce substantial “null” or missing data. In such cases, distance metrics such as the Jaccard distance may be much more appropriate, although that is beyond the scope of this lab. Hamming distances will be computed in an all vs. all fashion to generate a pairwise distance matrix that will subsequently serve as the input for distance-based tree-building algorithms. Run the following code chunk: # use hamming helper function to compute pairwise Hamming distance of final cgMLST dataset # loading user_defined cgMLST final dataset # cgmlst_final &lt;- fread(here(&quot;data&quot;,&quot;wgMLST_calls&quot;,&quot;cgmlst_final.tsv&quot;)) # compute Hamming distance # PATIENCE!!! this step might take several minutes depending on the size of the dataset dist_mat &lt;- cgmlst_final %&gt;% column_to_rownames(&quot;ID&quot;) %&gt;% t() %&gt;% hamming() # the dimension should be symmetric and should be the size of dataset (i.e. number of QC-passed genomes) dim(dist_mat) ## [1] 381 381 Note Nothing to see here…we print the matrix dimensions as a sanity check and to indicate the process is complete. Hierarchical Clustering of cgMLST Profiles by Hamming Distance In this section we will be performing hierarchical clustering of the Hamming distance matrix using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (i.e. UPGMA) algorithm. We’re not going to lie. UPGMA is just about the most basic and unsophisticated clustering algorithm out there. However, UPGMA is still widely used and is the default clustering implementation in the BioNumerics software currently used by PulseNet. Note In the lecture, we discussed eBURST, originally developed to cluster conventional 7-gene MLST, and GrapeTree, which was recently developed to analyze genome-scale datasets. Let’s cluster the Hamming distance matrix by running the code chunk below: # compute hierarchical clustering with hclust function and complete linkage method hc &lt;- dist_mat%&gt;% as.dist() %&gt;% hclust(method = &quot;complete&quot;) # reorder distance matrix according to the hc order dist_mat &lt;- dist_mat[hc$order, hc$order] # write reordered distance matrix to files write.table(dist_mat, here(&quot;output&quot;,&quot;clusters&quot;,&quot;dist_mat_ordered_cgmlst.tsv&quot;), quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) Cluster Extraction at Multiple Distance Thresholds Identifying clusters of genomes sharing highly similar cgMLST profiles through the application of distance thresholds is a common practice in genomic surveillance and epidemiological investigations. These genomic clusters can become “analytical units” that can be tracked across space and time: The detection of a novel genomic cluster comprising isolates from multiple human clinical cases can signal the emergence of an outbreak, thus requiring a public health response in order to contain further cases. An examination of the evolving genomic cluster over time can provide important epidemiological insights on outbreak progression. The co-clustering of outbreak isolates with isolates from food/environmental sources can assist epidemiologists investigating an outbreak by linking the outbreak isolates to isolates from possible sources/reservoirs of the pathogen. Identifying cluster membership for every isolate in the dataset at multiple distance thresholds gives us the analytical flexibility to define suitable thresholds for analyzing the pathogen in question. From a practical perspective, a threshold that is too fine-grained will yield a large proportion of the dataset in singleton clusters, making it difficult to link outbreak isolates to one another and to potential outbreak sources. Conversely, using a threshold that is not fine-grained enough will fail to fully exploit the discriminatory power of genomic data, grouping outbreak and non-outbreak isolates indiscriminately. Note Adjusting similarity thresholds for cluster membership can be used to tweak the granularity of clusters: higher distance threshold produce larger clusters whereas lower distance thresholds will produce smaller clusters. A threshold of 0 will generate clusters with identical profiles. In this section, we will harness the awesome power of the cutree R function to extract genomic clusters from the cgMLST dataset. This function allows us to generate cluster membership information at any given distance threshold, which can be used to generate summary tables that are foundational to computing genomic cluster statistics. The cutree function is infinitely flexible, allowing us to specify multiple distance cutoffs in parallel. In this lab, we will use this approach to compare how adjusting the threshold can be used to adjust the granularity of the resulting genomic clusters. We will then use cluster information to annotate a dendrogram. By analyzing cluster memberships and the associated metadata, we will look for possible outbreaks in the dataset. For membership at all possible distance thresholds, run the following code chunk: # Define genomic cluster membership at all possible distance thresholds cgmlst_loci = (ncol(cgmlst_final)-1) ## maximum distance interval = 1 ## edit interval of interest; currently set to 1 for all possible thresholds thresholds &lt;- seq(0, cgmlst_loci,interval) # extract cluster membership across multiple thresholds cluster_membership &lt;- map(thresholds, function(x) { hc %&gt;% cutree(h = x) %&gt;% as.factor() }) # create name for each threshold names(cluster_membership) &lt;- paste0(&quot;Threshold_&quot;, thresholds) # print clustering results table, no duplicated names are allowed ( clusters_all &lt;- data.frame(cluster_membership ) %&gt;% rownames_to_column(&quot;ID&quot;) ) # reactable(clusters_all) # write file of genomic cluster memberships at multiple thresholds write.table(clusters_all, here(&quot;output&quot;,&quot;clusters&quot;,&quot;clusters_all.tsv&quot;), quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) Questions: How many distinct thresholds are theoretically possible for this dataset? How would you determine the maximum number of allele differences across all genomes in the dataset based on the table above? hint: at some threshold, all genomes collapse to the same cluster… For membership at select distance thresholds, run the following code chunk: # Define genomic cluster membership at user-defined distance thresholds # Can either specify specific thresholds as a numeric vector i.e. c(0, 5, 10, 15) # If you&#39;re feeling lazy, you can also specify using c(seq(5, 100, 5)), which stands for &quot;go from threshold 5 to 100 in # increments of 5&quot;. You can also string multiple notations together within the same numerical vector. thresholds &lt;-c(0, seq(5, 100, 5), seq(200, cgmlst_loci, 100)) # currently reads as &quot;use threshold 0, # then from 5 to 100 in increments of 5 # then from 200 to maximum threshold # in increments of 100&quot; # extract cluster membership across multiple thresholds cluster_membership &lt;- map(thresholds, function(x) { hc %&gt;% cutree(h = x) %&gt;% as.factor() }) # create name for each threshold names(cluster_membership) &lt;- paste0(&quot;Threshold_&quot;, thresholds) # print clustering results table, no duplicated names are allowed ( user_defined_clusters &lt;- data.frame(cluster_membership ) %&gt;% rownames_to_column(&quot;ID&quot;) ) # write file write.table(user_defined_clusters, here(&quot;output&quot;,&quot;clusters&quot;,&quot;user_defined_clusters.tsv&quot;), quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) Questions: How many user-defined thresholds have we generated in the settings provided here? Which cluster does genome “ID9438” belong to at a threshold of 60 allele differences? How would you determine how many different clusters were generated at each particular threshold? Genomic Cluster Summary Tables In this section, we will use the helper function count_variables_by_cluster to generate summary tables that calculate counts for variables of interest across all of the genomic clusters in the dataset defined at a particular threshold. These variables are based on categories and subcategories contained in the metadata table. For example, if one of the categories in the metadata table is “Source”, the function will give us a breakdown of the source counts for each genomic cluster in the dataset (e.g. human, cattle, chicken, etc) . These cluster summaries can provide valuable insights on cluster composition, including regional, temporal, or source biases. Although such tables are not flashy, they are very useful for generating counts and statistics across all genomic clusters. Run the code chunk below: # assign clusters_all to clusters for visualization clusters &lt;- clusters_all summary_table &lt;- count_variables_by_cluster( # dist threshold used for cluster definition, can be adjusted; currently set to 50. # Note: the specificed threshold must be one of the user-defined thresholds in previous section distance_threshold = 50, vars = c(&quot;Source&quot;) # metadata variables to be used in cluster breakdown; currently using Source. # Can include more than one variable ) reactable(summary_table) # to see complete table, click on the summary_table object in the Global Environment panel in the # top right hand corner --&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;reactable html-widget html-fill-item&quot; id=&quot;htmlwidget-9eceb20dc2a931752ae4&quot; style=&quot;width:auto;height:auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;application/json&quot; data-for=&quot;htmlwidget-9eceb20dc2a931752ae4&quot;&gt;{&quot;x&quot;:{&quot;tag&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Reactable&quot;,&quot;attribs&quot;:{&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;cluster&quot;:[&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;8&quot;,&quot;9&quot;,&quot;10&quot;,&quot;11&quot;,&quot;12&quot;,&quot;13&quot;,&quot;14&quot;,&quot;15&quot;,&quot;16&quot;,&quot;17&quot;,&quot;18&quot;,&quot;19&quot;,&quot;20&quot;,&quot;21&quot;,&quot;22&quot;,&quot;23&quot;,&quot;24&quot;,&quot;25&quot;,&quot;26&quot;,&quot;27&quot;,&quot;28&quot;,&quot;29&quot;,&quot;30&quot;,&quot;31&quot;,&quot;32&quot;,&quot;33&quot;,&quot;34&quot;,&quot;35&quot;,&quot;36&quot;,&quot;37&quot;,&quot;38&quot;,&quot;39&quot;,&quot;40&quot;,&quot;41&quot;,&quot;42&quot;,&quot;43&quot;,&quot;44&quot;,&quot;45&quot;,&quot;46&quot;,&quot;47&quot;,&quot;48&quot;,&quot;49&quot;,&quot;50&quot;,&quot;51&quot;,&quot;52&quot;,&quot;53&quot;,&quot;54&quot;,&quot;55&quot;,&quot;56&quot;,&quot;57&quot;,&quot;58&quot;,&quot;59&quot;,&quot;60&quot;,&quot;61&quot;,&quot;62&quot;,&quot;63&quot;,&quot;64&quot;,&quot;65&quot;,&quot;66&quot;,&quot;67&quot;,&quot;68&quot;,&quot;69&quot;,&quot;70&quot;,&quot;71&quot;,&quot;72&quot;,&quot;73&quot;,&quot;74&quot;,&quot;75&quot;,&quot;76&quot;],&quot;Count&quot;:[14,4,1,8,1,1,28,1,15,27,10,3,5,4,4,1,1,1,2,2,5,12,6,32,5,1,15,12,1,6,3,1,11,6,4,5,1,1,1,2,6,1,4,1,5,5,1,1,5,1,4,33,6,1,13,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],&quot;Cattle&quot;:[3,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,10,0,0,9,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0],&quot;Chicken&quot;:[0,2,1,2,0,0,1,0,12,10,5,3,2,4,4,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],&quot;Human&quot;:[11,0,0,4,1,1,24,1,3,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,22,5,1,6,10,1,6,2,1,10,6,4,3,1,1,1,0,5,0,4,1,5,5,1,1,4,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1],&quot;Raccoon&quot;:[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],&quot;Skunk&quot;:[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],&quot;Water&quot;:[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,1,13,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]},&quot;columns&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;cluster&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;cluster&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;character&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;Count&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Count&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numeric&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;Cattle&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cattle&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numeric&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;Chicken&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Chicken&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numeric&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;Human&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Human&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numeric&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;Raccoon&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Raccoon&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numeric&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;Skunk&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Skunk&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numeric&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;Water&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Water&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numeric&quot;}],&quot;dataKey&quot;:&quot;3597068a0ea895ffcbebe6f4398215ee&quot;},&quot;children&quot;:[]},&quot;class&quot;:&quot;reactR_markup&quot;},&quot;evals&quot;:[],&quot;jsHooks&quot;:[]}&lt;/script&gt; Questions: How many human isolates are contained in cluster 22 at a threshold of 50 allele differences? Based on the characteristics of the cluster, what is the likely source of infection? What about cluster 24? Day 2: Visualizations to Facilitate Analysis Genomic Cluster Stacked Histogram Another useful tool in terms of exploring genomic cluster trends is to display cluster breakdown data such as we previously displayed in the summary tables described above in the form of a stacked histogram. The purpose of the function cluster_summary is to compare metadata variable distributions across all genomic clusters defined at a given distance threshold by generating one stacked histogram per metadata category. The resulting stacked histograms can be used to quickly scan through and examine all clusters for categorical variables to identify clusters with biased composition. Metadata variables can be used to probe for genomic clusters with specific biases (i.e. source, regional, temporal, etc). For example, you may identify a genomic cluster in which 60% of isolates a from human clinical isolates, indicating a lineage that poses a significant human health risk. Run the following code chunk: # Generate cluster summaries for stacked histograms # NOTE: there needs to be a comma at the end of each line of code! cluster_summary( distance_threshold = 50, # the distance threshold used for cluster definition; currently set to 50. clade_name = NULL, # which clade to include? vars = colnames(meta)[-1], # use metadata variables only panel.ncol = 2, # number of columns to arrange the panels into rm.low.freq.clust = T, # Filter to remove low frequency (N &lt; 4) clusters interactive = T # True/False on whether to generate interactive plots.

Questions: Can you identify a T50 cluster larger than 10 genomes that is restricted to a single province? How about a cluster found across multiple decades? One with pronounced seasonal bias? Tell us everything you know about cluster 33? Distance Matrix Visulization via Ordered Heatmap A very useful visualization when dealing with distance matrices involves performing clustering, arranging the entries of the matrix based on the clustering order, and displaying the similarity as a heatmap. This produces a heatmap with a distinct 45 degree axis in which clusters of profiles with significant similarity representing possible clades/lineages can be plainly seen as “pockets of heat”. In this section of the lab, we will visualize the distance matrix using the ComplexHeatmap package and we will be comparing these clades to available serotype information on the isolates by overlaying serotype information on the heatmap, which will allow us to examine whether the organism’s serotype is concordant with putative lineages defined by cgMLST similarity as displayed on the clustered heatmap. Note In an era prior to various forms of molecular analysis, serotype was used as a proxy for genetic similarity of microbial isolates. For organisms like Salmonella, serotype determination is still a widely employed rapid screen. Let’s run the code chunk below: # create column annotations for heatmap # to display clade information set.seed(123) heatmap_annot &lt;- metadata$Serotype names(heatmap_annot) &lt;-metadata$ID heatmap_annot &lt;- heatmap_annot[order(factor(names(heatmap_annot), levels = rownames(dist_mat)))] # create heatmap dist_mat %&gt;% Heatmap( name = &quot;cgMLST\\nDistance&quot;, show_row_names = F, # do not display row labels show_column_names = F, # do not display column labels # use custom color gradient col = colorRamp2( c(min(dist_mat), mean(dist_mat), max(dist_mat)), c(&quot;#f76c6a&quot;, &quot;#eebd32&quot;, &quot;#7ece97&quot;) ), # add column annotation to show serotype info overlaid on the clustered heatmap top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( Serotype= heatmap_annot, col = list( Serotype = structure(brewer.pal(length(unique(heatmap_annot)), &quot;Set3&quot;), names = unique(heatmap_annot)) ) ) ) Questions: Although many traits are essentially restricted to a single monophyletic genomic lineage, it is also possible that some traits are observed across multiple lineages and may therefore appear to be polyphyletic. Is there a serotype that looks like the latter? What is your interpretation of the last major “pocket” of heat at the bottom right of the heatmap? bonus: although higher heat is seen along the 45 degree axis, there is some “residual” heat off-axis. What does it mean? Annotated Dendrograms and Cluster Evaluation Here you will convert hierarchical clustering result (hc) into a dendrogram using the as.phylo() function from the ape package. To visualize the resulting dendrogram, we will use the R package ggtree, which offers an extensive suite of functions to manipulate, visualize, and annotate tree-like data structures. In this section, you will be introduced to some of the different visual capabilities of ggtree and we will progressively update the same tree with several layers of visual annotations based on available metadata. Note Note that there is a massive amount of information in the interwebs dedicated to ggtree and all of its capabilities for advanced visualizations. Here we will barely scratch the surface. Circular vs. Rectangular Dendrograms for Simple Tree Visualization Radial vs. Rectangular dendrograms are different ways of visualizing a tree. Radial trees are capable of displaying a lot of simple data in a smaller footprint. In contrast, rectangular trees can display more complex data in a visualization that is easy on the eyes. Rectangular trees rendered as pdf format allow you to really zoom into sub-branches of the tree in greater detail when viewed in a pdf reader or in a browser window. This is essential when you’re dealing with larger datasets comprising hundreds of isolates such as the one we are dealing with here. Run the following code chunks to: Plot a circular tree of the entire dataset with the tree tips colored by serotype information. You can assign a different metadata field to the color_var variable to update the mapping of the color aesthetics in the tree. For example setting color_var = \"Province\" will color the tree tips by the province of origin. Plot the same tree as a rectangular tree. # convert hierarchical clustering to a dendrogram set.seed(123) cg_tree &lt;- as.phylo(hc) # also, write out the dendrogram to a Newick tree file, can be imported into ITOL or other tree visualization software for manual annotation write.tree(cg_tree, file= here(&quot;output&quot;,&quot;trees&quot;,&quot;tree_complete_linkage.newick&quot;)) # visualization with a color variable using R ggtree color_var &lt;- &quot;Serotype&quot; # editable variable, currently set to &quot;Serotype&quot;. ## filter out unknown serotypes to define the number of colors needed for remaining serotypes n_colors &lt;- length(unique(pull(metadata, !!sym(color_var)))) ## create circular dendrogram with variable-colored tippoints cg_tree_cir &lt;- cg_tree %&gt;% ggtree(layout=&#39;circular&#39;, # set tree shape size = 1 # branch width )%&lt;+% metadata + geom_tippoint(aes(color = !!sym(color_var)), size = 2,na.rm=TRUE) + guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3) ) ) + scale_color_manual(values = distinctColorPalette(n_colors),na.value = &quot;grey&quot;) # cg_tree_cir # Create rectangular tree with serotype tip points and text tip labels # create tip labels metadata &lt;- metadata %&gt;% mutate(tip_lab = paste0(Province,&quot;/ &quot;,Date,&quot;/ &quot;,Source)) ## plot set.seed(123) cg_tree %&gt;% ggtree(layout= &quot;rectangular&quot;, # tree shape size = 1 # branch width )%&lt;+% metadata + geom_tippoint(aes(color = !!sym(color_var)), size = 2,na.rm=TRUE) + geom_tiplab(aes(label = tip_lab), offset = 5, align = TRUE, linetype = NULL, size = 1) +theme_tree2()+ geom_treescale(y = 370, x = 0.2) + guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3) ) ) + scale_color_manual(values = distinctColorPalette(n_colors)) # We save to pdf format ggsave(here(&quot;output&quot;,&quot;trees&quot;,&quot;clade_subtree_rec.pdf&quot;), height = 45, width = 40) Questions: Between serotypes G and H, which one appears to be more heterogeneous based on cgMLST data? How would you improve the colour palette used to display serotype – no, seriously? Superimposing Genomic Cluster Information onto Dendrograms Let’s now superimpose the genomic cluster information on the previous dendrograms (Radial &amp; Rectangular) to examine whether the above code chunk for extracting cluster memberships at various thresholds has generated sensible cluster assignments. Run the code chunk below to insert text labels that span across tree tips assigned to the same clusters at a specified threshold. Note You can edit the target_threshold variable to examine how cluster membership changes in response to clustering distance cutoffs. Run the code chunk below for the radial tree: # Radial tree visualization # assign clusters_all to clusters for visualization clusters &lt;- clusters_all target_threshold &lt;- 50 # Editable variable, currently set to a threshold of 50. metadata&lt;- metadata%&gt;% select(-tip_lab) # variable to subset clusters target_variable &lt;- paste0(&quot;Threshold_&quot;, target_threshold) # create cluster group list object cluster_grp &lt;- clusters %&gt;% select(ID, target_variable) %&gt;% group_by(!!sym(target_variable)) %&gt;% {setNames(group_split(.), group_keys(.)[[1]])} %&gt;% map(~pull(., ID)) # sequester singleton clusters cluster_grp &lt;- cluster_grp[which(map_dbl(cluster_grp, ~length(.)) &gt; 10)] # create clade group list object meta2 &lt;- metadata%&gt;% filter(Serotype != &quot;unknown&quot;) Clade_grp &lt;- meta2 %&gt;% select(ID, Serotype) %&gt;% split(f = as.factor(.$Serotype)) %&gt;% map(~pull(., ID)) # add cluster memberships and clade information to tree object cg_tree &lt;- groupOTU(cg_tree, cluster_grp, &#39;Clusters&#39;) cg_tree &lt;- groupOTU(cg_tree, Clade_grp, &#39;Serotype&#39;) # plot core genome tree where colored blocks = clusters and text annotations = clades cg_tree %&gt;% ggtree(layout=&#39;circular&#39;, # Editable tree shape, currently set to circular? size = 1 # branch width ) + # add colored blocks to display clades geom_hilight( mapping = aes( node = node, fill = Serotype, subset = node %in% map_dbl( Clade_grp, ~getMRCA(cg_tree, .) ) ) ) + #add text annotations to display clusters geom_cladelab( mapping = aes( node = node, label = Clusters, subset = node %in% map_dbl( cluster_grp, ~ getMRCA(cg_tree, .) ) ), horizontal=T, angle = &#39;auto&#39;, barsize = 0.75, offset = 50, offset.text = 50, align = T ) + # legend parameters guides(fill = guide_legend( nrow = 11, override.aes = list(alpha = 0.8) ) ) + labs(fill = &quot;Serotype&quot;) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Paired&quot;) Questions: The radial dendrogram above displays serotype and also T50 cluster information for clusters larger than 10. What can you infer about the overall cgMLST similarity of genomes corresponding to serotype F? hint: they’re not all in the same T50 cluster… Run the code chunk below for the rectangular tree: # Rectangulat tree visualization # NOTE: there needs to be a comma at the end of each line! serovar_subtree( tree = cg_tree, serovar_name = NULL, # which clade cluster to visualize? distance_threshold = 50, # the dist threshold used for cluster definition? color_by = &quot;Serotype&quot;, # which metadata variable to color tree tips by? color.tiplab = F, # whether to color tip labels tip.size = 4, # size of tree tip point label_vars = c(&quot;geo_loc&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Source&quot;), # metadata vars only label.offset = 80, # distance between labels and tree tips label.size = 2, # tree tip label text size legend.x = 0.1, # legend position on x axis legend.y = 0.98, # legend position on y axis legend.size = 6, # legend text size legend.ncat.per.col = 8, # number of categories to show per column in legend hide.legend = F, # whether to hide colour legend plot.xlim = 2300, # plot area width annot.offset = 3, # distance between heatmap and tree tips annot.textsize = 5, # heatmap x axis text label size annot.barsize = 0.75, # annotation bar width show.title = T # whether to display distance threshold ) # We export the tree to pdf format in the /output/trees folder (clade_subtree2.pdf; # check the folder navigation pane at the bottom right). # The file can be dropped into a web browser so you can zoom into individual genomic clusters. ggsave(here(&quot;output&quot;,&quot;trees&quot;,&quot;clade_subtree2.pdf&quot;), height = 45, width = 60,limitsize = FALSE) Questions: The tree above is rendered too small in R studio to be of any use except to ruin your eyes. Open the corresponding pdf file (/output/trees/clade_subtree2.pdf) on your web browser. How many T50 clusters are associated with serotype F? What can you tell us about T50 clusters 30 and 46? Displaying a Specific Cluster Subtree In order to examine the clustering patterns in the cgMLST dendrogram at greater resolutions, we will work with a number of R functions introduced below. These functions are used in conjunction to zoom in on specific sublineages so that we may further explore the strains within. The purpose of the function cluster_subtree is to visualize subtrees of specific clusters defined at a given distance threshold. The cluster is defined by its ID and the distance threshold used for genomic cluster assignment, which are defined by the variables cluster_name and distance_threshold, respectively. We recommend scanning the summary tables or stacked histograms used above to look for clusters that may merit some zooming into. Run the following code chunk: # NOTE: there needs to be a comma at the end of each line! Threshold &lt;- paste0(&quot;Threshold_&quot;, c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50)) # User-defined thresholds specified in the # distance vector. # Currently set to 0, 10, 20, 30 40, 50 Cluster_tree &lt;- clusters %&gt;% select(ID,Threshold) # This line selects the cluster+treshold combination # for the subtree visualization ## plot tree cluster_subtree( tree = cg_tree, clusters = Cluster_tree, distance_threshold = 50, # the dist threshold used for cluster definition, from the list in L767 cluster_name = &quot;24&quot;, # Cluster ID to visualize. color_by = &quot;Season&quot;, # Metadata variable to color tree tips by; currently set to Province color.tiplab = F, # whether to color tip labels tip.size = 3, # size of tree tip point legend.x = 0.1, # legend position on x axis legend.y = 0.85, # legend position on y axis legend.size = 5, # legend text size legend.ncat.per.col = 8, # number of categories to show per column in legend hide.legend = F, # whether to hide colour legend plot.xlim = 60, # plot area width label_vars = c(&quot;ID&quot;, &quot;Province&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Source&quot;), # User can add any metadata variable to display label.offset = 9.2, # distance between labels and tree tips label.size = 4, # tree tip label text size annot.offset = 0.1, # distance between heatmap and tree tips annot.width = 0.3, # heatmap width annot.textsize = 4, # heatmap x axis text label size annot.nthreshold = 6 # number of clustering thresholds to display # note: the visualization below has been tweaked for optimal viewing of 6 thresholds. Adjustment to the various # parameters above may be necessary if adding or removing additional thresholds to improve legibility in the subtree ) Questions: What distance threshold is necessary to tease apart the fact that strain ID09120 is not like the others? Taking into account that we are labeling the leaves of the tree using information for “Season”, what can you say about the set of isolates from ID04684 to ID05454 as we go from a threshold of 10 allele differences down to a thresdhold of 0? Ah, we see you’re done…a little early… Using the rectangular dendrogram with enhanced annotations provided, which was generated using iTOL, find genomic clusters that fit the following criteria and consider possible scenarios for interpretation of genomic data and epidemiological metadata: a. A genomic cluster that at T50 splits into multiple multi-strain subclusters when examined at T0 b. Find a polyphyletic serovar (again) c. A genomic cluster comprising human clinical cases with similar geographical and temporal information d. A genomic cluster in which the human clinical cases are dispersed in geography and/or time e. A genomic cluster in which human clinical isolates cluster with non-human isolates from a common source type f. A genomic cluster in which human clinical isolates cluster with non-human isolates from multiple source types. g. What&#39;s the story on T20 cluster #102? h. **Bonus Question:** How would you define the &quot;optimal&quot; distance threshold for extracting and reporting genomic clusters? State your position... Note ggtree is certainly an excellent tool but there is definitely a bit of a learning curve, though there is also a lot of material online. For building trees with more complex annotations, a good option is iTOL, though it certainly has a learning curve of its own. Some Final Points to Remember… Note that it’s important to remind ourselves that outbreaks lie along a spectrum in their genetic and epidemiological characteristics and this will be reflected in terms of how clustering and metadata annotations will show up on a dendrogram/subtree, or in the breakdown of metadata variables across genomic clusters. Some outbreaks are typified by highly genetically similar isolates from clinical cases that are highly restricted in time and space (e.g. the point-source outbreak where some people at the picnic ate the potato salad contaminated with a single strain of the pathogen). At the other end of the scale, some outbreaks comprise genetically heterogeneous pathogen isolates from clinical cases that are dispersed in time and/or space (e.g. people exposed through consumption of a nationally-distributed food product contaminated with several strains during a production run). Thus, identifying an outbreak from genomic surveillance data alone is not always possible. Although genomic data represents strong evidence in an outbreak investigation, there is no substitute for some good ’ol shoe-leather epidemiology to place everything in context.
